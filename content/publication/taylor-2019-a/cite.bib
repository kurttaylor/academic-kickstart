AB  - BACKGROUND: The extent to which changes in gene expression can influence 
      cardiovascular disease risk across different tissue types has not yet been 
      systematically explored. We have developed an analysis pipeline that integrates 
      tissue-specific gene expression, Mendelian randomization and multiple-trait 
      colocalization to develop functional mechanistic insight into the causal pathway 
      from a genetic variant to a complex trait. METHODS: We undertook an expression 
      quantitative trait loci-wide association study to uncover genetic variants 
      associated with both nearby gene expression and cardiovascular traits. Fine-mapping 
      was performed to prioritize possible causal variants for detected associations. 
      Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was then applied using findings from 
      genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to investigate whether changes in gene 
      expression within certain tissue types may influence cardiovascular trait variation. 
      We subsequently used Bayesian multiple-trait colocalization to further interrogate 
      the findings and also gain insight into whether DNA methylation, as well as gene 
      expression, may play a role in disease susceptibility. Finally, we applied our 
      analysis pipeline genome-wide using summary statistics from large-scale GWAS. 
      RESULTS: Eight genetic loci were associated with changes in gene expression and 
      measures of cardiovascular function. Our MR analysis provided evidence of 
      tissue-specific effects at multiple loci, of which the effects at the ADCY3 and 
      FADS1 loci for body mass index and cholesterol, respectively, were particularly 
      insightful. Multiple-trait colocalization uncovered evidence which suggested that 
      changes in DNA methylation at the promoter region upstream of FADS1/TMEM258 may also 
      affect cardiovascular trait variation along with gene expression. Furthermore, 
      colocalization analyses uncovered evidence of tissue specificity between gene 
      expression in liver tissue and cholesterol levels. Applying our pipeline genome-wide 
      using summary statistics from GWAS uncovered 233 association signals at loci which 
      represent promising candidates for further evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: Disease 
      susceptibility can be influenced by differential changes in tissue-specific gene 
      expression and DNA methylation. The approach undertaken in our study can be used to 
      elucidate mechanisms in disease, as well as helping prioritize putative causal genes 
      at associated loci where multiple nearby genes may be co-regulated. Future studies 
      which continue to uncover quantitative trait loci for molecular traits across 
      various tissue and cell types will further improve our capability to understand and 
      prevent disease.
